              A. Scope - double height, double width
              * b. static vs. non-static - static information can be accessed in the whole code.
              * c. return type - double
              * d. method name (identifier) - getArea
              * e. parameters - public
              * f. method body - return height * width; this is the part that will be exicuted

     I think that this would be the answers i just am unable to open the code in the files you proveided
